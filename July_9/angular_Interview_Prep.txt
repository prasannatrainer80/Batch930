1) What is Angular 

	Angular is a framework that which allows you to create any standalone,desktop and distributed applications. 

If you want to make any single page applications, then angular is best. 

2) What is Single Page Applciation

An application that which interacts with user by dynamically rewriting the current page rather than loading entire new pages
from server, which is known as partial page rendering

3) What are elements of angular

 	-> Modules

	-> Components

	-> Templates

	-> Directives

	-> Pipes

	-> Services 

	=> Routing

4) What is module 

Module is a place where we can refer group of components, directives, pipes, and services. Each angular application contains atleast one module and module will be decorated with annotation known as @NgModule


In Angular by default we have a file called app.module.ts file which is known as module file. 

This file contains various sections known as 

1) Declarations : Contains group of custom components available 

2) Imports  : Any system directives to be imported, then we need imports Example : FormsModule, HttpClientModule, 

3) providers : Contains list of user defined services available.

4) bootstrap : Which component to be started will be there in bootstrap. 

5) What is Component

Components are heart w.r.t. Coding... Any kind of code we need to write in component and call them in the given application.  

You can create any component as 

ng g c component_name

Once component created, it generates 4 files known as

component.html
component.ts
component.css
component.spec.ts


html contains all databinding code
ts file contains all business logic
css for design
spec.ts file contains any test cases


DataBinding : Used to bind values/properties/events to the given component.

Angular supports two-way binding, means model to view and view to model any modifications be taken affected automatically 

For two-way binding, we need to import FormsModule in app.module.ts file, and use [(ngModel)] directive for this. 

For event binding we need to use (click) ->

Angular stores all dependencies in package.json file. as it is heart and registers all the dependency version numbers etc...

For printing data, we have interpolation {{ }} for display any values.

*ngIf

*ngFor

*ngSwitch

Services : 
___________

What is Angular HTTP Service : 

Angular contains Http Services, which allows you to consume restful apis in angular application. 

For this first, we need to add HttpClientModule to the imports section of app.module.ts file that enables HttpServices in your application. 

What is Dependency Injection : 

It is a coding design pattern, in which a class receives its dependencies from external resources rather than creating themself. 

Example : 

the code without DI

employ : Employ;

constructor(
   this.employ = new Employ();
)

the code with DI

constructor(employ) {
	this.employ = employ;
}


Example : 

in service, we wrote 

constructor(private _httpClient : HttpClient) {
}

then it allocated memory for HttpClient that is called DI

in component we wrote as


constructor(private _employService : EmployService) {
...
...
...
}

How the HTTP Mechansim will work

At first, using any programming language, we need to consume database records in json format and generate url. Example 

http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

Now this service we need to consume in angular and render this in angular form. 

For this we have various angular services as

get  -> Used to get any resoures (select command) 

 validateCustomer(user : string, pwd : string) : Observable<any> {
    return this._httpClient.get("http://localhost:1111/custAuthenticate/"+user+"/"+pwd);
  }

post : Used to for inserting data into database 


put  : used for insert/update operations 

delete : Used for delete operation.

What is Observables : 

If you want to capture values from the service we need the help of observables. 

Why we prefer observables are, they are powerful and we can process them asynchronously 

Observables can be cancellable. 

The data in observables will be stored in HttpResonse format. 

We need to capture data by using subscribe method in angular components. 

subscribe method converts http observable response into class objects or specific string or etc...

Most Front-end applciations will communicate with backend services over the HTTP protocol using XMLHttpRequest interface. The HttpClient in @angular/common/http offers a simple Http Client API for angular applications where data can be exposed to outside world. 

Steps to be followed : 

1) Add HttpClientModule in app.module.ts imports with header file @angular/common/http

2) Create a service and in service file constructor create an object to HttpClientModule

		constructor(private _httpClient :HttpClient) { }

3) Consume the services using HttpGet or HttpPost 

Get for retrieve resources, Post for insert data into DB

4) Create a component and in that component invoke the services  

5) Render the result in HTML page.
